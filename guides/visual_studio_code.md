Then you should be able to see a list of prepared tasks for creating and running new ROR application like in the screenshot

![image info](./media/tasks_list_in_vs_code.png)

Here is the meaning of the tasks:
* `Init new project` - use this task just once to initialize a new project.
* `Build environment` - use it when you need to update the environment or you commit to Gemfile.
* `Run environment` - this task runs the environment. Also it starts a debugger session and waits for connection. More info about debugger [here](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/wiki/3.-Attaching-to-a-debugger) 
* `Run shell node` - this task "teleports" you to the command shell where you can execute **node**, **npm**, **ng**, etc. commands.
* `Stop environment` - this task stops the environment.

By default, your app will be initialized in ./application directory. But you can change it for any other you like in the .env.example file which is in the ./environment directory.

You can change very basic environment variables for your application with .env.example file. Like so: 
* PROJECT_NAME
* APP_PATH

Basically this is all you need to start your new cool project. Using Visual Studio Code.

After **Run environment** says `âœ” Compiled successfully.` your project will be able to visit by `http://${PROJECT_NAME}.localhost`. By default, it's `http://test_project.localhost`.
